This is my blog.

This is the first post.

## Why start a blog?

I want to start a blog because I want to have a place to call my own on the internet. A place where I can do whatever I like. It's a place to share things I've learnt, things I've done or things that I think are interesting. In a longer and more flexible format than a twitter account. 

As an engineer a blog is especially exciting because it's something which I can craft using the skills of my trade. To use a somewhat hamfisted analogy, my website is to me like a personal workshop is to a carpenter. It's a place where I can practice my craft, hone my skills, or experiment and try out new things. There are no consequences, no customers, no deadlines.

It's a playground! :tada:

## A single journey starts with one step

When I decided to start a blog I had high hopes for it's hosting and design. Like I said, it's a playground! I wanted a handmade golang micro-cms, full AWS hosting (S3, mongoDB, lambda) a lightweight reactive frontend, markdown rendering, all rolled up with snazzy CI etc etc... :astonished:

I messed around with this for a few weeks before realising I'd lost sight of what I was doing. First and foremost, I wanted a blog. My wildly nebulous and ambitious spec requirements were distracting me and I was no closer to having somewhere to actually blog. I decided to get an MVP up and work on it from there.

Version 1 is a lightly adjusted [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) template ([hugo-theme-basic](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-basic/)) hosted with [render.com](https://render.com/). Getting it up and running was a handful of commands. I'll write a blog post about how I did it soon (I can do that now because I have a blog).

## What's in a name?

The final note for this intro blog is to mention the name - failing-gracefully. I didn't choose it just for the cool pun. Only partially. It's a goal. Failing, gracefully. Failure is necessary, it's expected, it should be embraced. Learning how to fail, and how to recover from failure is, in my opinion, essential to both being a good developer, and a good human. I hope this blog reflects that.
